## Problem - C(Iftar Party): 

 Simple Number theory application. Using prime factorization of a number.
 - determine remain Piaju's.
 - Prime factorzie of remain Piaju's.
 - Think when answer will be `Impossible`.


## Problem - D(Find the Good Sequence) : 

 - two numbers are called "good" if their difference is at least 2
 - a sequence is good if the sequence is increasing
 - a sequence is good adjacent two elements are good
 - a sequence length at least 2
  
 Simple observation and Binary Search on answer(len) Probelem. Now determine on new observation, then optimization. When we get a sequence, this   length will decrease untill it reachs into less then 2. Then agin determine this good sequence/
 Just determine the monotonic function.

## Problem - E(Ecological Bin Packing) :
 - Determine `what says` in the Problem
 - How many waays you can select bin
 - now fixed three different bin and others glass bottle will be be moved to their particular bin
 - now think `how to implement this Problem?`
 - try Sample testcase
