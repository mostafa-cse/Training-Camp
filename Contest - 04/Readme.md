## Problem A : 
  - Simple Constructive Problem
  - math and math
  - <details> Goal : Approach Constructive Problem.</details>

## Problem B : 
  - This is number theory and constructive Problem
  - Use Prime seive for determine prime factorization
  - <details> Goal : No Goal </details>

## Problem C : 
  - somthing stupid mathematics
  - all Formula:
    - For First Knight Move = i * i
    - for Second knight Moves = (i * i) - 1
    - For K Knights Moves = (i * i)Ck
 
    - for 2knights Move = (i * i)C2 = i * i * (i * i - 1) / 2
    - Attacking Move = 2[horizontal 2x3 grid] * 2[vertical 2x3 grid] * (i-1)*(i-2)
      
    - `ans = i^2 * (i^2 - 1) / 2 - 4 * (i - 1) * (i - 2) [2x3 and 3x2 grid]`
    - <details> Goal : Mathematics observation, Combinatorics, sum of N numtural number. </details>

## Problem D :
  - Best of Number Theory problem [Hard problem on this contest]
  - Think about prime number and Over all Complexity of Testcase
  - think how can reduce the complexity while countiing divisor
  - count all divisor and subtruct those which in less then k
  - <details> Goal : Prime seive, Count divisor, store Prime in efficient way. </details>

## Problem E : 
  - constructive Problem
  - determine when we dont get solution
  - divide this value `[1 - N]` into two sets
  - use set, Multiset, PBDS as your wish
  - <details> Goal : implementation Knowladge. </details>

## Problem F : 
  - Simple Binary Search On answer(JUMP)
  - determine minimum jump, this is a[1] for `[1 - based index]`
  - low = a[1], high = 1e9 * 1e5;
  - just Implement upper_bound of Binary search
  - <details>Goal : Binary search on answer</details>

## Problem G : 
  - Good Problem for Implement Pow function
  - <details> Goal : customs Pow implement </details>

## Problem H : 
  - This is math Problem
  - the formula for determine digit in any base for Number Num, base B , `Digit = log(Num) / log(B)`
  - go back to log operation, `log(a x b) = log(a) + log(b)`
  - Pre-compute factorial Log value using prefix-sum
  - <details> Goal : Base conversation, Log operation </details>

## Problem I : 
  - This is simple use of `legendre's formula`
  - read about `legendre's formula` on Internet
  - <details> Goal : legendre's formula </details>

## Problem J : 
  - Implementation Problems
  - Simple use of logic why we iterate from right to left
  - <details> Goal : Bruteforces </details>
