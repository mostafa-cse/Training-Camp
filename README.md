# 🏆 Competitive Programming Training Program

Welcome to the **Competitive Programming Training Repository**! This is a curated resource and progress tracker for students under my mentorship. The goal is to transform passionate coders into skilled, contest-ready programmers for competitions like **ICPC**, **IUPC**, **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, and more.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures  
- Practice solving problems under time constraints  
- Develop team strategy and collaboration skills  
- Track progress and prepare for real contests  

---

## 📅 Training Roadmap

### 1. **Foundation Phase**
- Language: C++ STL / Python 3 essentials
- Complexity analysis
- Basic problem types: brute force, greedy, implementation
- Data structures: arrays, stacks, queues, hash maps

### 2. **Algorithmic Core**
- Graphs: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find
- Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, State Optimization)
- Number Theory: modulo, sieve, GCD, primes
- Binary Search & Divide-and-Conquer

### 3. **Advanced Techniques**
- Segment Trees / BIT
- Trie, Suffix Arrays, Hashing
- Bitmask DP, Matrix Exponentiation
- Geometry, Combinatorics, HLD (as needed)

## 🤝 Contribution & Teamwork

If you're part of the training group:
- Submit your code in your personal folder in `/practice/`
- Update your weekly progress in `progress.md`
- Help others and participate in discussions

---

## 🧠 Tips for Trainees

- Focus on understanding, not just solving
- Learn from every wrong answer
- Review editorials and implement unseen approaches
- Consistency beats intensity
